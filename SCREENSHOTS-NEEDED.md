# Screenshots Needed

Post-deployment task: capture screenshots from the live HiTechClaw AI instance to add to documentation and in-app help. Do this after Session 12 (Docker + GitHub push) when the app is running with real or realistic demo data.

**Tip:** Use a consistent browser window size (1280x800 for desktop, 390x844 for mobile). Dark theme screenshots will match the app's aesthetic.

## How to Capture

1. Deploy HiTechClaw AI via Docker on the Dell or Hetzner EU
2. Run through the setup wizard (capture each step)
3. Register 2-3 demo agents with realistic names
4. Send ~50 test events with varied types (messages, tool calls, errors)
5. Include at least one event that triggers each threat class
6. Set a budget limit so the budget bar shows progress
7. Create a workflow from a template
8. Add 1-2 infrastructure nodes
9. Capture each screenshot at the specified browser size
10. Save to `docs/screenshots/` in the repo (add to .gitignore if large, or compress to <200KB each)

## Priority

- **Must-have (before GitHub launch):** #1 (hero), #4-9 (setup wizard), #11 (dashboard)
- **Nice-to-have:** Everything else — adds polish but the docs work without them
